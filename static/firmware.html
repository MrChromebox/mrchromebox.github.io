    <h3 id="top">ChromeOS Device Firmware</h3>
    <p>
      The firmware used by ChromeOS devices is built around serveral open-source projects, and consists (mainly) of a hardware init component (<a href="http://www.coreboot.org" target="_blank">coreboot</a>) and one or more payloads (depthcharge for Verified Boot and ChromeOS, <a href="http://www.seabios.org" target="_blank">SeaBIOS</a> for Legacy Boot Mode) which are subsequently executed.  The firmware resides on an SPI flash chip and uses the layout shown below.  The shaded sections at the bottom are read-only, which is enforced by the firmware write-protect screw on the main board (sometimes with a sticker as well on some newer models).  When we talk about updating the firmware on ChromeOS devices, we're referring to either the RW_LEGACY or (RO) BOOT_STUB sections, or to the entire firmware image (often referred to as a "full ROM").  These three update types are described in more detail below.

    <h3>Firmware Update Types</h3>
    <p>
      <ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <li><strong>RW_LEGACY</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Updates/replaces the stock legacy boot payload (SeaBIOS) included on many models; 
            supplements the ChromeOS / secure boot payload</li>
            <li>Leaves all stock functionality intact, including the Developer Mode boot screen and Recovery Mode functionality</li>
            <li>Allows device to dual-boot another OS alongside ChromeOS</li>
            <li>Does not require disabling the firmware write-protect</li>
            <li>Carries zero risk of bricking the device</li>
            <li>On many models, includes bugfixes and enables additional functionality</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The <strong>RW_LEGACY</strong> firmware is for users who want to dual-boot ChromeOS + Linux/Windows, or users who want to run Linux/Windows without having to open the device/disable the firmware write-protect (and are ok with the accompanying limitations).
          </p>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>BOOT_STUB</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Replaces the ChromeOS Verified Boot firmware payload (depthcharge) with a legacy boot payload (SeaBIOS)</li>
          <li>Removes the Developer Mode boot screen (white "OS verification is OFF")</li>
          <li>Removes the ability to run ChromeOS, creating a small risk of bricking your device</li>
          <li>Requires the firmware write-protect to be disabled</li>
          <li>When flashed via the ChromeOS Firmware Utility Script, has a "built-in" backup function, so easy to restore without having to keep track of the backup file</li>
          <li>Stop-gap solution for devices which don't have a Full ROM firmware available</li>
          <li>Leaves the Recovery Mode ( <span class="keystroke">[ESC+REFRESH+POWER]</span> ) initiation intact
            <ul type="square">
              <li>If you engage this key sequence, your device will try to boot into Recovery Mode, which no longer exists</li>
              <li>To escape the Recovery Mode "black hole", you will have to disassemble the device and briefly disconnect the battery</li>
              <li>TL;DR - be careful not to do it :)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <strong>BOOT_STUB</strong> firmware is for users who want to run Linux, but a Full ROM isn't available for their device.
        </p>
      </li>
      <br>
      <li><strong>Full ROM</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A complete firmware image which includes updated/customized versions of the hardware init  (coreboot) and legacy boot payload (SeaBIOS) components contained in the stock firmware; some devices have the option of a UEFI-compatible firmware also, which replaces the legacy boot component with a UEFI boot one (Tianocore)</li>
          <li>Removes the developer mode boot (white "OS verification is OFF") screen</li>
          <li>Completely removes the ability to run ChromeOS (and ChromeOS Recovery Mode), creating a small risk of bricking your device</li>
          <li>Offers the best support for booting all OSes besides ChromeOS</li>
          <li>On many models, adds full hardware support for virtualization (vmx / VT-x)</li>
          <li>Fixes many bugs and/or idiosyncrasies associated with the stock firmware (but could potentially add new ones)</li>
          <li>Essentially turns your ChromeOS device into a "regular" PC / laptop</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <strong>Full ROM</strong> firmware is the best option for users who want to run Linux/Windows exclusively, and who don't mind opening their device to disable the firmware write-protect.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> 
      <br>All three firmware update types are available via the <a href="javascript:document.getElementById('fwscript').click()">ChromeOS Firmware Utility Script</a>, though not all types are available for all devices.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>ChromeOS Firmware Boot Flags (GBB Flags)</h3>
    <p>
      The firmware boot flags / Google Binary Block (GBB) flags are firmware level settings stored directly in the firmware flash chip itself in a read-only (RO) area, and therefore require the firmware write protect to be disabled before setting. The GBB flags control the behavior of the firmware payload used to boot ChromeOS (depthcharge); they are used to set the default boot mode (ChromeOS or Legacy Boot Mode),  the Developer Mode boot screen timeout (2s or 30s), prevent exiting Developer Mode via spacebar, and to enable Legacy Boot Mode regardless of crossystem <code>dev_boot_legacy</code> setting, among other things. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> The GBB Flags are only valid when using the the stock firmware, or stock + RW_LEGACY firmware update.  They have no effect (and cannot be set) when using either the BOOT_STUB or Full ROM firmware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most users should not attempt to set these manually, but instead use the <a href="javascript:document.getElementById('fwscript').click()">ChromeOS Firmware Utility Script</a> to set them based on their preferred default boot mode and boot timeout (the script automatically sets the Developer Mode and Legacy Boot Mode overrides for all options except factory default). For those curious, a full description of all the GBB flags can be found in <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/vboot_reference/+/master/firmware/include/gbb_header.h"  target="_blank">Google's source code here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Custom Firmware / Firmware Updates</h3>
    <p>
      The components of the stock firmware for any given ChromeOS device can be found in the device-specific branches of Google's firmware trees:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/" target="_blank">https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot</a><br>
      <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/depthcharge/" target="_blank">https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/depthcharge</a><br>
      <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/seabios/" target="_blank">https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/seabios</a><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, the coreboot component for the Asus Chromebox CN60 (PANTHER) is <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/+/firmware-panther-4920.24.B" target="_blank">https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/+/firmware-panther-4920.24.B</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Google firmware branch for a specific device is pretty much a fixed snapshot of the firmware component at/around the time of the device's release, and usually has minimal bugfix updates after release.  In contrast, the firmware updates available here via the Firmware Utility Script are built using the latest upstream (main / master copy) source code directly from the coreboot and SeaBIOS projects, with additional fixes/tweaks applied on top.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upstream repositories for coreboot and SeaBIOS can be found on github:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot" target="_blank">https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot</a><br>

      These repos contain not only the source used to build the current firmware releases, but also the build scripts and configurations used as well.  The only components not included are the various binary "blobs" which are not redistributable; if you want to build your own firmware, you have to extract these blobs from your existing factory firmware (there are instructions for doing so <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/upstream-coreboot-on-intel-haswell-chromebook" target="_blank">on chromium.org</a>; these are written for Haswell devices but apply more broadly).
